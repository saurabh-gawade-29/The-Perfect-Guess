## About the development

This is a hobby project 

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ However, it still gives a good idea on how to make a CLI application.


## Basic Rules

- First Enter any number between 1 to 100
- Then CLI response as per you enter a number
- Chose next number based on response
- Repeat this step until you choose correct number
